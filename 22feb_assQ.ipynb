For example, you might use df.head() to check the first few rows of a DataFrame after loading it from a file.\n","\n","describe(): This function provides a statistical summary of the DataFrame, including count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and quartile values. For example, you might use df.describe() to get a summary of the data in a DataFrame.\n","\n","drop(): This function is used to remove a column or row from the DataFrame. For example, you might use df.drop('column_name', axis=1) to remove a column from the DataFrame.\n","\n","groupby(): This function is used to group the DataFrame by one or more columns and perform operations on the groups. For example, you might use df.groupby('column_name').mean() to get the mean value of a column for each group.\n","\n","sort_values(): This function is used to sort the DataFrame by one or more columns. For example, you might use df.sort_values('column_name') to sort the DataFrame by a specific column.\n","\n","fillna(): This function is used to fill missing values in the DataFrame with a specific value or method. For example, you might use df.fillna(0) to fill missing values with zeros.\n","\n","pivot_table(): This function is used to create a summary table from the DataFrame. For example, you might use pd.pivot_table(df, values='column_name', index='index_name', columns='column_name2', aggfunc=np.mean) to create a pivot table that summarizes the data by two columns."],"metadata":{"id":"acJ6Xp7gAEEw"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q6.
